		<hr>
		<p>DemDissent is online news service that aims to cover the stories that, typically, get brushed under the rug by the mainstream media. In an age of corporate dominace over the news media landscape, there are fewer and fewer outlets that practice truly independent journalism. At DemDissent we try to correct this problem to the best of our abilities. From trade issues to taxes rates to the events surrounding the Black Lives Matter movement, DemDissent aims to cover the stories you will not hear on CNN, FOX or MSNBC. As the line between our governement and our media becomes more and more blurry, we aim to maintain a level of independence and thoughtfulness that our readers deserve.
		<br><br>
		DemDissent was founded in 2015. Our headquarters are in Oakland, California. We are constantly envolving and love to hear from our readers. If you would like to reach out to us, you may do so through our contact page, found here.</p>
